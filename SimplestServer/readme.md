# Simplest express Server

* written using ES6 javascript
* try run it with 'node ./server.js' and it will fail because node doesn't know ES6 and we need a transpiler (babel)
* installing babel-cli we get 'babel-node' tool to run ES6 code
* we have to configure babel creating the file '.babelrc' and add preset 'es2015'
* run the script with 'npm run server' or 'npm start'
